    "My project creates an online version of the card game, \"War.\" It asks for your name and prefered difficulty(General/difficult or Cadet/easy). It then asks if you need a rulebook and provides one if needed. Then, you receive your \"army\" of cards, and begin comparing random cards from your hand with random cards from the computer's hand. If your card has a higher value than the computer's, you receive a flag point. Otherwise, the computer receives a flag point. Depending on the difficulty level, a different number of flags corresponds to a win. Have fun!"

Lastly, I wrote docstrings for all seven of my functions and wrote tests for four functions (one over the requirement). "
